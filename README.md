This project implements a Dino game in a Gymnasium environment where the player controls a dinosaur (black square) to avoid obstacles like cacti. The state includes the Dino's position, velocity, and the obstacle's position and speed. The player can either jump or do nothing to avoid obstacles. Positive rewards are given for successfully avoiding obstacles, while a large penalty is given for collisions. As the game progresses, the obstacles get faster, making the game more challenging.
